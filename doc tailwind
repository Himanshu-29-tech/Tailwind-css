tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.

Installation

Using Vite

Installing Tailwind CSS as a Vite plugin-->>
Installing Tailwind CSS as a Vite plugin is the most seamless way to integrate it with frameworks like Laravel, SvelteKit, React Router, Nuxt, and SolidJS.

01
Create your project

Start by creating a new Vite project if you don’t have one set up already. The most common approach is to use Create Vite.
#Terimanl

npm create vite@latest my-project
cd my-project

2->install Tailwind CSS

Install tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/vite via npm.

Terminal

npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

3->Configure the Vite plugin

Terminal->

Add the @tailwindcss/vite plugin to your Vite configuration.

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})

4-> Import Tailwind CSS

Add an @import to your CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS.

@import "tailwindcss";

5->
Start your build process

Run your build process with npm run dev or whatever command is configured in your package.json file.

terminal
npm run dev

6->
Start using Tailwind in your HTML

Make sure your compiled CSS is included in the <head> (your framework might handle this for you), then start using Tailwind’s utility classes to style your content.

<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link href="/src/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">
    Hello world!
  </h1>
</body>
</html>
