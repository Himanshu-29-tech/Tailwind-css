# Tailwind CSS + Vite Setup Guide

## 📌 Overview
**Tailwind CSS** works by scanning your HTML files, JavaScript components, and templates for class names, generating the required styles, and writing them to a static CSS file.  
It is fast, flexible, reliable, and zero-runtime.

---

## ⚙️ Installation — Using Vite
Installing Tailwind CSS as a **Vite plugin** is one of the smoothest ways to integrate it with modern frameworks like Laravel, SvelteKit, React Router, Nuxt, and SolidJS.

---

## 🧱 Step 1 — Create a Vite Project
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-project
cd my-project
```

---

## 📦 Step 2 — Install Tailwind CSS
```bash
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

---

## 🔧 Step 3 — Configure Vite Plugin
Edit your `vite.config.js` or `vite.config.ts` file:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [tailwindcss()],
})
```

---

## 🎨 Step 4 — Import Tailwind CSS
Add this line to your main CSS file (example: `style.css`):

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

---

## ▶️ Step 5 — Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧪 Step 6 — Use Tailwind Classes in HTML
Make sure your compiled CSS file is linked inside `<head>`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link href="/src/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">
    Hello world!
  </h1>
</body>
</html>
```
